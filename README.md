# UOAnimUOPAnalyzer
Simple program which shows the Ultima Online UOP animations, also it shows all the "internal" data for each entry.<br>
It's not mantained, its purpose was to have a better understanding of how the uop files and animations worked and to write code that would later be integrated in another application, Leviathan.
